# MY PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATIONS

## DESCRIPTION

This repository contains my professional certifications that indicate the results of the hands-on training I have done so far in my career. Presently, my experiences are in the following areas:

1. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems for model-based design of systems that run on power electronics.
2. Software programming and software testing using the latest version of JavaScript and Python3; and unit testing using Mocha, UnitTest, and Pytest.
3. Version Control solutions using Git-based tools such as GitHub. The knowledge is also transferable to other tools such as GitLab or BitBucket.
3. Data Engineering using Python-based tools to inspect, clean, and validate datasets.

I will keep this updated as I improve my professional tool box in the future
